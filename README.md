## Overview

The RedTeam AI-Assisted Offensive Security Toolkit is a comprehensive platform that helps security professionals perform systematic penetration tests following the standard attack lifecycle. It provides a unified interface to various offensive security tools with intelligent assistance for tool selection, usage, and result interpretation.

## Features

- üß† **AI-Assisted Operations**: Intelligent guidance and assistance throughout penetration testing phases
- üîç **Comprehensive Reconnaissance**: Automated discovery and enumeration capabilities
- üí• **Versatile Payload Generation**: Various payload formats for different target environments
- üîì **Advanced Privilege Escalation**: Tools and techniques for vertical movement
- üß∞ **Modular Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with industry-standard security tools
- üìä **Detailed Reporting**: Automated report generation with findings and recommendations
- üîí **OPSEC Controls**: Built-in operational security measures
- üåê **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Attack Lifecycle Phases

The toolkit follows the standard attack lifecycle:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering on the target
2. **Initial Access / Payload Generation**: Creating and delivering attack payloads
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Elevating access within the target system
4. **Credential Access / Lateral Movement**: Moving across the network
5. **Post-Exploitation / C2 / Pivoting**: Maintaining access and expanding control
6. **AV/EDR Evasion**: Bypassing security controls
7. **Persistence & Anti-Forensics**: Establishing persistent access
8. **OPSEC & Anonymity Infrastructure**: Maintaining operational security
